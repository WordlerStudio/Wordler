In order to compile Wordler you need to install:
- gcc and g++ (GNU C Compiler): compiling the project
- python: build script
- make (optional): more handy commands for the build script (explained later)

From my experience, I recommend you to not use `mingw32` on Windows and use `mingw32-w64` (you can find it on winlibs.com)

There are some handy command you should know:

- `make`: makes the project (release)
- `make release`: makes the release of a project and launches it.
